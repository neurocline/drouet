Drouet is an experimental rewrite of [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), "A Fast and Flexible Static Site Generator built with love". You don't want to use this, you want to use Hugo instead.

## Overview

I love Hugo, but I don't love the current structure of the code. This is an experiment,
or really, a set of experiments.
